# SkyStone_Configs
Robot configuration files for the SkyStone season.
These files, which define robot hardware configurations, normaly reside on the Robot Controller (RC) Android phone, Internal storage, top-level folder name "FIRST".  Configuration files have an extension of .xml and reside directly in the folder FIRST.  OpMode software codes reside below FIRST, in folders named for the language (i.e. "blocks" and "java"); however these OpModes are not managed here in this repository, but rather under the module TeamCode in the ftc_app repository.
